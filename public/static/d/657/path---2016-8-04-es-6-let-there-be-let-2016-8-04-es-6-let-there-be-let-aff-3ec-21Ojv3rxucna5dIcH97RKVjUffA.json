So, along came es6 with the new\nshiny <strong><em>let</em></strong>.</p>\n<h2>Block level scoping</h2>\n<p>In javascript the setting of a variable can be the cause of bugs due to way javascript allows\nthe assigning of values. For example, in the code below you would think that declaring and\nassigning a value to a variable inside a block of code would isolate it from the rest of the\ncode. But javascript does not have block level scoping. So, in the code below the variable\n<strong><em>messageInBottle</em></strong> takes its value from the second assignment and not the first.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">var messageInBottle = &#39;Help me!&#39;;\n{\n  var messageInBottle = &#39;Would you like a pen pal?&#39;; \n}\nconsole.log(messageInBottle);\n\n// output: Would you like a pen pal?\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\nJavascript has function level scoping which encapsulates ***var*** declarations and assignments \nand therefore in the code below the first assignment of ***messageInBottle*** is unaffected by the \nsecond assignment.</code></pre></div>\n<p>var messageInBottle = ‘Help me!‘;</p>\n<p>function bottle() {\nvar messageInBottle = ‘Would you like a pen pal?’;\n}</p>\n<p>console.log(messageInBottle);</p>\n<p>// output: Help me!</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>With es6 the introduction of the <strong><em>let</em></strong> keyword introduces block level variable scoping. This\nallows the declaration and assignment of variables that have block level scope. Now we can\nsee that the first <strong><em>messageInBottle</em></strong> <strong><em>let</em></strong> variable retains its value as the second\n<strong><em>messageInBottle</em></strong> <strong><em>let</em></strong> variable is restricted to the scope of its code block. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">let messageInBottle = &#39;Help me!&#39;;\n{\n  let messageInBottle = &#39;Would you like a pen pal?&#39;; \n}\nconsole.log(messageInBottle);\n\n// output: Help me!\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\n## Hoisted by your own petard\n\nIn the code below we would expect the output to be the range of numbers 0-9 squared but \nthe output is in fact the number 10 repeated 10 times. This occurs due to the reference \nof ***n*** pointing to the value of n in the loop which has exited when it incremented to \nthe number 10. This variable hoisting moves the declaration of the variable ***n*** out \nof the loop and instead to the top of the function scope.</code></pre></div>\n<p>var squares = [];</p>\n<p>for (var n = 0; n &#x3C; 10; n ++) {\nsquares.push(function() {\nconsole.log(n * n);\n});\n}</p>\n<p>squares.forEach(function(s) {\ns();\n});</p>\n<p>// output:\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10\n// 10</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>This can be solved by using a closure which are nested functions that retain a reference to\nthe enviroment in which they were created. The closure retains the value of n that it was\npassed during its creation. We now see the expected output of the range 0-9 squared.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">var squares = [];\n\nfor (var n = 0; n &lt; 10; n ++) {\n   squares.push(function(i) {\n     console.log(i * i);\n   }(n));\n}\n\nsquares.forEach(function(s) {\n});\n\n// output:\n// 0\n// 1\n// 4\n// 9\n// 16\n// 25\n// 36\n// 49\n// 64\n// 81\n\n{% endhighlight %}\n\n\nThe newly introduced ***let*** keyword can help us gain the expected output by its ability \nto create a new instance of ***n*** each time the code goes through the for loop.</code></pre></div>\n<p>var squares = [];</p>\n<p>for (let n = 0; n &#x3C; 10; n ++) {\nsquares.push(function() {\nconsole.log(n * n);\n});\n}</p>\n<p>squares.forEach(function(s) {\ns();\n});</p>\n<p>// output:\n// 0\n// 1\n// 4\n// 9\n// 16\n// 25\n// 36\n// 49\n// 64\n// 81</p>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>Photo Credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@celestekorol\">Celeste Korol</a> via <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"ES6 Let there be let","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2016-8-04-es6-let-there-be-let/2016-8-04-es6-let-there-be-let/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-3-18-react-random-squares-avatar/2017-3-18-react-random-squares-avatar/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"React Random Squares Avatar"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2016-7-14-es6-string-template-literals/2016-7-14-es6-string-template-literals/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ES6 String Template Literals"}}}}
