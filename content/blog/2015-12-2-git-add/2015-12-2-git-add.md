## Simple git workflow

When working on my personal projects I have always followed a simple git workflow that involves nothing more 
complicated than creating a new branch adding and comitting my changes into the new branch, then merging the 
new branch into master and pushing it to <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">bitbucket</a> or 
<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github</a>.

```
git branch "NewBranch"
...make changes....
git add -A
git commit -m "Added changes"
git checkout master
git merge NewBranch
git push
```


## What does git add -A actually do?

### Git Version 1.x

In git version **1.x** `git add -A` is a shorthand way of typing the `git add --all` command that stages (adds) all new, modified and deleted files. 
This is in itself a shorthand way of typing the commands

```
git add .
git add -u
```

where `git add .` stages new and modified files only  and `git add -u` stages modified and deleted files only.

```
# For the next commit
$ git add .   # stage only files new or modified files 
$ git add -u  # stage only files modified or deleted files 
$ git add -A  # stage files new, modified or deleted files 
```

### Git Version 2.x

In git version **2.x** the `git add` commands have changed so that `git add .` is now equivalent to `git add -A` 

```
# For the next commit
$ git add .   # stage files new, modified or deleted files 
$ git add -u  # stage only files modified or deleted  files 
$ git add --ignore removal  # stage only new or modified files 
$ git add -A  # stage files new, modified or deleted
```

So, when I upgrade from git **1.x** to **2.x** I will be able to save typing one character by using `git add .` instead.
