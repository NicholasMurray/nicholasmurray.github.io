Here are my top 10 podcasts for coding

2. <a href="http://devhell.info/" target="_blank">Dev Hell</a> Presented by Chris Hartjes and Ed Finkler this podcast has a php slant which is saved by Chris getting on his unit testing hobby horse. Ed's native advertisements for the sponsors are both simultaneously hilarious and cringeworthy.
